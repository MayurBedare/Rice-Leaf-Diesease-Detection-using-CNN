# Rice Leaf Disease Detection


## About

Rice Leaf Disease Detection is a mini project that aims to automatically detect and classify common diseases in rice leaves using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The project consists of a web application built with React.js for the frontend and FastAPI for the backend. Users can upload an image of a rice leaf, and the system will predict whether it is affected by leafblast, leafblight, or other common diseases.


## Technologies Used

- Frontend: React.js, HTML, CSS
- Backend: FastAPI, Python
- Deep Learning: TensorFlow, Keras (for building and training the CNN model)
- Deployment: Docker (optional)

## Features

- Rice leaf disease classification into leafblast, leafblight, and others.
- Supports image upload from the user interface.
- Fast and responsive API for quick predictions.
- Extensible and modular code structure for easy maintenance and updates.
- Dockerized application for easy deployment.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy of the project up and running, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
